Security Considerations:

1. Specifies the version of Solidity, using semantic versioning. Lock pragmas to specific compiler version - #SWC-103

2. Conforms to checks-effects-interactions pattern to protect against - #SWC-107

3. Check for conditions and throw an exception if the condition is not met - #SWC-110 & #SWC-123

4. Explicitly mark visibility in functions and state variables - #SWC-100 & #SWC-108
